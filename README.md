# Project Title

This project contains the boilerplate that must be used when dealing with Solidity based Smart Contracts developmen projects.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```bash
# Install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
# Install proper node version
nvm use
```

Create `.env` file (you can base on [`.env.example`](./.env.example))
### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```bash
# Install the dependencies
npm install
```

### Generate Types

In order to get contract types you can generate those typings when compiling

```bash
npm run compile
```

## Running the tests

```bash
npm run test
```

### Testing with Waffle

Tests using Waffle are written with Mocha alongside with Chai. 

Is recommended to use Gherkin as a language to describe the test cases

```
describe("Feature: Greeter", () => {
  describe("Scenario: Should return the new greeting once it's changed", () => {
    let greeter: Greeter;
    it("GIVEN a deployed Greeter contract", async () => {
      const factory = await ethers.getContractFactory("Greeter");
      greeter = <Greeter>await factory.deploy("Hello, world!");
      expect(await greeter.greet()).to.equal("Hello, world!");
    });
    it("WHEN greeting message changed", async () => {
      await greeter.setGreeting("Hola, mundo!");
    });
    it("THEN greet returns new greeting message", async () => {
      expect(await greeter.greet()).to.equal("Hola, mundo!");
    });
  });
});
```

We are requiring Chai which is an assertions library. These asserting functions are called "matchers", and the ones we're using here actually come from Waffle.
